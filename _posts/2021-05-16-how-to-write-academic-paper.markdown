I read this book first in English, the British English, then I read it in Chinese at one night and I finish it very fast. 

There are some reflections about this book from me, and I want to jot it down fast and concisely:

First, I feel the charater is pathetic. He didn't know what are important for him. Just accept things happening naturally. I would say he lost the sensing of hope.

Second, he didn't stay away from evil people and didn't know how to refuse and his way of friendship was supporting the bad guy doing evil things. That was sad. If someone does bad things, he or she will never be my friends anymore. Remember never do business with devils. If you get close to them, maybe one day you will behave like them. It's not easy or possible to change people's behavior, but we can choose what we want to behave and head for the type of life we want to enjoy.

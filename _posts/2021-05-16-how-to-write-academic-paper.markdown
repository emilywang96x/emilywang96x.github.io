I read this book first in English, the British English, then I read it in Chinese at one night and I finish it very fast. 

There are some reflections about this book from me, and I want to jot it down fast and concisely:

First, I feel the charater is pathetic. He didn't know what are important for him. Just accept things happening naturally. I would say he lost the sensing of hope.

Second, he didn't stay away from evil people and didn't know how to refuse and his way of friendship was supporting the bad guy doing evil things. That was sad. If someone does bad things, he or she will never be my friends anymore. Remember never do business with devils. If you get close to them, maybe one day you will behave like them. Humanity doesn't deserve to be tested. People are easy to get tempted. Reflect on it everyday, choose the right choice. It's not easy or possible to change people's behavior, but we can choose what we want to behave and head for the type of life we want to enjoy.

Third, I was thinking if his mom and he accepted that his mom were happier when staying at the Home, and he cannot afford a nice life for his mom, what should he do? But I do think at least he should pay more visit to his mom. It reminds me of my mom. Instead of passively accepting she can be happy herself, I should try my best to add happiness to her To support her and comfort her.

Fourth, the law system at that time was awful, people cared more about whether he was moral or not, instead of whether he commited the crime of murder. It makes me feel like it is easy to get lost in people's words especially "like or dislike", "favor or "disfavor" stuff. Does that really matter? Whether you like or not, things will still be there. Care too much about like or not will make you stay naive. You should care about the purpose. You should allow things that you dislike exist there. 

Fifth, the charater's mom started another love story at her last stage of life, that was romantic. I admire her courage of restarting her life again and still believe in love and chase for it. Everyone deserves happiness and should have the courage to look for it and try it out. 

Sixth, about marriage, if a man says marrying you or not do not matter, he doesn't love you. :) 

Seventh, it's easy to get lost, and people do grow for their entire life. So constantly reflecting on yourself and keeping on learning are very important. Life is short, make it meaningful, beautiful, richful, romantic, artistic, and free, is the wish I hold for you.

Thanks for this book, I got many small points from it.
